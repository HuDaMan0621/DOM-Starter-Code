        Dragon Ball Z (Japanese: ドラゴンボールＺゼット, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is a Japanese
        anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to Dragon Ball and adapts the latter 325
        chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly
        Shōnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 26, 1989 to January 31, 1996,
        before getting dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, and Latin
        America. It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide.[4] It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.

            Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against
            villains ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell) and other creatures (Majin Buu). While the original
            Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his
            adult
            life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rival
            Vegeta.
        </p>
        Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially
        released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases
        which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball franchise; including 15 movies, 2 TV
        specials, and 148 video games (many of them being only released in Japan), and a host of soundtracks stemming
        from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through numerous adaptations and re-releases,
        including a more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai.[a] There have also been two sequel series;
        Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015–2018)..</p>
